Carboxy-Terminal Amino Acid Sequence of a Human Fibrinogen y-Chain 
Variant ( T I ) +  
Carlota Wolfenstein-Todel* and Michael W. Mosesson**§ 
ABSTRACT: A normal human fibrinogen y-chain variant, 
termed y’, is larger than the y chain (5 1 500 vs. 49 500) due 
to an extended COOH-terminal sequence. The extended 
COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide (CNBr e’) was 
isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and its amino 
acid sequence was determined. Comparison with the corre- 
sponding COOH-terminal y-chain peptide (CNBr e) showed 
that the last four amino acids of the y chain were replaced 
in y’ chains by a 20-residue fragment rich in aspartic and 
glutamic acids, having the sequence Val-Tyr-Pro-Glu-His- 
R e c e n t  reports indicate that a human fibrinogen y-chain 
variant, termed y’ (Mosesson et al., 1972), has a higher mo- 
lecular weight than the y chain (5 l 500 vs. 49 500) (Wolfen- 
stein-Todel & Mosesson, 1980; Francis et al., 1980) due to 
an extended COOH-terminal amino acid sequence (Wolfen- 
stein-Todel & Mosesson, 1980). The y’ chains are more 
negatively charged than y chains and are separable by gel 
electrophoresis at pH 8.6 or 2.7 (Mosesson et al., 1972), by 
isoelectric focusing, or by ion-exchange chromatography 
(Stathakis et al., 1978). There are no significant differences 
in their sialic acid or phosphorus contents (Finlayson & 
Mosesson, 1963; Mosesson & Finlayson, 1963). 
The variant y’ chains are functionally normal with respect 
to cross-linking in the presence of factor XIIla and undergo 
this process nonselectively with respect to y and y’ chains 
(Wolfenstein-Todel & Mosesson, 1980). Analyses of S- 
carboxymethyl derivatives of y and y’ chains that had been 
labeled with dansylcadaverine indicated that the glutamine 
cross-linking receptor site and the lysine cross-linking donor 
site were the same in both types of chains. Available data also 
indicated that the sequence of the y’ chain was the same as 
that of the y chain from the NH2 terminus to at least as far 
as the terminal five amino acids of the y chain. 
Earlier analyses of mutant y chains (y Paris I) from a 
congenitally dysfunctional fibrinogen molecule (fibrinogen 
Paris I) showed that both y and y’ features were expressed 
in the mutant y chains (Stathakis et al., 1978), a finding 
suggesting that y and y‘ chains had been produced from a 
single gene. Thus, our speculations regarding peptide pro- 
cessing events that could lead to the formation of these variant 
chains included the possibilities that y’ chains represent (a) 
a naturally occurring “read through“ protein (Korner et al., 
1979) or (b) an incompletely processed precursor of the y

determined the amino acid sequence unique to the y’ chain. 
Materials and Methods 
Plasma fibrinogen fraction 1-4 (Blomback & Blomback, 
1956) (thrombin clottability >95%), the y-chain population 
of which is comprised of approximately 7-10% y’ chains 
(Mosesson et al., 1972), was prepared as previously described 
(Mosesson & Sherry, 1966). Reduction and S-carboxy- 
methylation were carried out as previously reported (Galanakis 
et al., 1978), and the S-CM’ y and y’ chains were isolated 
by DEAE-cellulose gradient elution chromatography in 8 M 
urea at pH 7.0 (Stathakis et al., 1978). CNBr cleavage of 
S-CM peptides was carried out as described by Gross & 
Witkop (1962). The CNBr digests were subjected to gel- 
sieving chromatography at room temperature on a column (1.5 
X 90 cm) of Sephadex G-75 that had been equilibrated and 
developed with 10% formic acid. The flow rate was 6.2 mL/h, 
and fractions of 2.4 mL were collected. 
HPLC was performed with equipment from Waters Asso- 
ciates (Milford, MA). It included two M-6000A pumps, one 
M-660 solvent programmer, a U6K universal liquid chroma- 
tography injector, and an M-450 variable wavelength detector 
attached to an Omni-Scribe recorder (Houston Instruments, 
Austin, TX). Peptide samples were subjected to chromatog- 
raphy at room temperature at a flow rate of 2 mL/min on a 
Waters pBondapak C-18 column (30 X 0.4 cm) using aceto- 
nitrile (HPLC grade; Fisher Scientific Co., Fair Lawn, NJ) 
for developing the column under isocratic or linear gradient 
conditions. All eluting solutions contained 0.1% phosphoric 
acid (Hancock et al., 1978), and the samples themselves were 
also dissolved in 0.1% phosphoric acid. The peptides eluting 
from the column were detected by their absorbance at 225 nm, 
pooled appropriately, freeze-dried, and then desalted by 
chromatography at room temperature on a column of Seph- 
adex G-15 (1.8 X 27 cm) that had been equilibrated and 
developed with 10% formic acid at a flow rate of 36 mL/h.

samples were applied to the column in 2 mL of 10% formic acid, and 
the column was then developed with the same solvent at a flow rate 
of 6.2 mL/h: fractions of 2.4 mL were collected. The pooling of 
fractions of interest (Le., peak 111) is indicated by the shaded areas. 
Tryptic digestion of peptides was performed with TPCK- 
treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, 
NJ) in 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, for 6 
h at 37 OC, at an enzymesubstrate ratio of 150. The digest 
was then freeze-dried. 
Amino acid analysis was carried out with a JEOL amino 
acid analyzer, Model JLC-6AH, on peptides that had been 
hydrolyzed in evacuated and sealed tubes for 20 h with 5.7 
N HCI containing 0.1% phenol. Numerical values for each 
amino acid were generally expressed in terms of residues per 
peptide. 
NH,-terminal analysis was performed by an adaptation 
(Mosesson et al., 1973) of the dansyl chloride method of Gray 
& Hartley (1963). NH,Terminal 
sequence analysis by Ed- 
man degradation was performed manually (Gray, 1972) with 
dansylation of aliquot fractions to label and identify the 
NH,-terminal residues at each step. PTH-glutamic acid and 
PTH-glutamine were distinguished by thin-layer chromatog- 
raphy as described by Summers et al. (1973). 
Results 
There were no apparent differences in the elution profiles 
obtained by Sephadex G-75 chromatography of CNBr digests 
of y and y’ chains, respectively (Figure I). The peak con- 
taining the COOH-terminal peptide of the y chain (peak 111) 
(Sharp et al., 1972; Henschen et al., 1976) and the corre- 
sponding peak obtained from the y’ chain were freeze-dried. 
The peptides contained in these fractions were first compared 
by HPLC by using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (1&45%) 
containing 0.1% phosphoric acid (data not shown). From this

preliminary procedure we selected 22.5% acetonitrile and 0.1% 
phosphoric acid as the eluant for isocratic chromatography 
of the COOH-terminal CNBr peptide of the y’chain (Figure 
2). As assessed by comparison with the chromatogram of 
peak I11 of the CNBr y chains, peaks 1-4 were unique to y’. 
Since amino acid analyses of material from each peak were 
virtually the same, we have designated them collectively as 
CNBr e’ (Table I). 
(Sequence analysis was performed on 
pools of peaks 2 and 3, whereas tryptic digestion was carried 
out on a pool of all four peaks.) 
The sequence of the first 30 amino acids of CNBr e’ was 
determined by dansyl-Edman degradation (we observed a 
“gap” at position 25). The first 23 residues were identical with 
those of CNBr e (Sharp et al., 1972; Takagi & Doolittle, 
1975). Amides in these first 23 residues of CNBr e’ were 
assigned by analogy with the established sequence of CNBr 
e and from the observation that tryptic peptide Tc (Table I) 
from y’ chains behaved in the same way in fingerprint analysis 
as the corresponding y-chain peptide (Wolfenstein-Todel & 
Mosesson, 1980). 
CNBr e’ was digested with trypsin, and the resulting pep- 
tides were subjected to HPLC by using gradient elution from 
12.5% to 45% acetonitrile (Figure 3). 
The peptides that 
emerged were labeled in order of their elution and were des- 
ignated Ta, Tb, etc. Peptide Tb was not pure; peptides Td

and Te were obtained in too low a yield to give satisfactory 
amino acid compositions. The amino acid composition of the 
other tryptic peptides is shown in Table I. Ta, Tg, and Ti 
probably were formed as a result of contaminating chymo- 
tryptic activity in the trypsin preparation. Peptide Ti is evi- 
dently included in Tg. Peptide Th had the same amino acid 
composition as Tf, and we therefore presume that they have 
essentially the same sequence. Most likely the two peptides 
differ in the degree of amidation of Asp and/or Glu residues 
(see paragraph at end of paper regarding supplementary 
material). 
The sequence of Tf was established by dansyl-Edman 
analysis (Figure 4). The majority of the steps were confirmed 
by amino acid analysis after back-hydrolysis of the PTH de- 
rivatives. Gln-23 and Glu-27 were determined by thin-layer 
chromatography of the PTH-amino acids. Since the dansyl 
derivatives of His and Arg could not be readily distinguished 
by thin-layer chromatography, His was identified in position 
2 by back-hydrolysis and amino acid analysis of the PTH 
derivative; Arg-38 was positioned by exclusion.

e. Residues 1-23 of CNBr e are the same as shown for CNBr e’. 
The known cross-linking acceptor (XL,) and donor (XLD) sites are

Discussion 
Our previous studies (Wolfenstein-Todel & Mosesson, 1980) 
showed that the y’ chain had an extended COOH-terminal 
sequence relative to y chains and suggested that the y’ se- 
quence was the same as that of the y chain from “,-terminal 
tyrosine to at least as far as the lysine donor cross-linking site 
that is located five residues from the y chain COOH-terminus. 
In this study we have determined by sequence analysis of 
CNBr e’ that the y’ chain is identical with the y chain up to 
four residues from the y chain COOH-terminus (corre- 
sponding to residue 23 of CNBr e’; Figure 4). Beyond this 
point the sequence is unique to the y’ chain and is rich in 
aspartic acid and glutamic acid (some of these residues may 
be amidated). The presence of these acidic residues accounts 
for the difference in charge between y and y’ chains (Mosesson 
et al., 1972; Stathakis et al., 1978). 
Analysis of mutant y chains (y Paris I) from a congenitally 
dysfunctional fibrinogen molecule (fibrinogen Paris I) showed 
that both y and y’ features were expressed in the mutant y 
chains (Stathakis et al., 1978). This finding implies that both 
chains are produced from a single gene, since otherwise it 
would be necessary to postulate that an identical mutation had 
occurred in two separate genes (e.g., y and y’), a less likely 
possibility. 
If the “single gene” hypothesis is assumed to be correct, 
there are several possible explantations for the occurence of 
y’ chains. On the basis of our present sequence data, it seems 
highly improbable that the y’ chain represents a naturally 
occurring “read through” protein (Korner et al., 1979) or an 
unprocessed “precursor” of y chains, since in both cases the 
COOH-terminal sequence of the y chain would be completed 
and then followed by additional amino acids. This is not the 
case since the last four amino acids of the y chain are replaced 
in y‘ chains by a unique 20-residue fragment. We suggest 
from these findings that different mRNAs for y and y’ chains, 
respectively, are transcribed from a single gene by differential 
RNA splicing (Darnell, 1979). This explanation corresponds 
to that which has been proposed to account for the existence 
of membrane-bound and secreted forms of immunoglobulin 
p chains, which differ from one another only by their 
COOH-terminal sequences (Singer et al., 1980; Early et al., 
1980; Alt et al., 1980). In view of the apparently widespread 
Occurrence of y/y’ variants among mammalian species (Fin- 
layson & Mosesson, 1964), we believe that this heterogeneity 
reflects important physiological differentiation of y chains, 
although their exact nature remains to be discovered.

ABSTRACT: The effects of temperature and pH on the solution 
conformation of native prothrombin fragment 1 were examined 
with 'H NMR spectroscopy. A calcium-dependent quenching 
of the intrinsic protein fluorescence was used to monitor 
calcium binding to fragment 1 as an indicator of functional 
protein. The native fragment 1 NMR spectrum contained 
several features indicative of a folded protein: (a) nonequiv- 
alent histidyl C-2 resonances at 7.9 and 8.1 ppm, (b) two 
resonances of nearly equal intensity at 7.26 and 7.32 ppm, and 
(c) a resonance at -1.04 ppm. Temperature studies showed 
that thermal unfolding of fragment 1 (even at 80 "C) was

which occurred subsequent to the unfolding. The basis for this
